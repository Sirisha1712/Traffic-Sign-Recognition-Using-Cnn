# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to detect and classify traffic signs. It is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
GTSRB dataset with 43 different traffic sign classes.

## 🧠 Model
- CNN with multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Trained using TensorFlow/Keras

## 🧪 Features
- Train CNN on traffic sign data
- Test on new images
- Accuracy achieved: 95%+

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tsr_cnn.py
